# CITS3403Project
CITS3403 Project

The purpose of this project is to build an online daily puzzle similar to WORDLE. It should be easy to play via mobile devices and it would be written using HTML, CSS, FLASK, AJAX, JQuery, and Bootstrap. Our group decided to build a game of showing a daily picture and user need to guess the place of it.
Our group has divided the project to three parts, including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. After grouping three files together, we will test it by using our laptops and mobile devices see if it can run properly or not. Since there are three parts, each person in our group will be responsible for one of them.

We decided to give users 5 guesses to guess it, the picture will refresh daily, we will also provide instruction button for users who are new to the site. We’ll try to design the site as detailed as we can and provide functionality to the buttons.
The user will try to guess by typing in the form box until they get it right in 5 tries, after guessing, it will display a winning text box, and a losing one if they run out of guesses.
All of us commit contribution to the documentation and each of us doing HTML, CSS and JavaScript separately, we also try to edit each other files to see if they collided with some problems on them.
We haven’t gotten a chance to test them on a live server (flask), because we have been busy with other projects, we just have them tested in sample.
