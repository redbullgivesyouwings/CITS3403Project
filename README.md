CITS3403 Project

The purpose of this project is to build an online daily puzzle similar to WORDLE. It should be easy to play via mobile devices and it would be written using HTML, CSS, FLASK, AJAX, JQuery, and Bootstrap. Our group decided to build a game of showing a daily picture and user need to guess the place of it.
Our group has divided the project to three parts, including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. After grouping three files together, we will test it by using our laptops and mobile devices see if it can run properly or not. Since there are three parts, each person in our group will be responsible for one of them.
